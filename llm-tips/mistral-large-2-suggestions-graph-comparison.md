To compare the two graphs (original and randomized) and the resulting networks, you can use several metrics and visualization techniques. Here are some suggestions:

### 1. Graph Metrics Comparison

Compare key graph metrics such as degree distribution, clustering coefficient, and betweenness centrality to ensure that the randomization has altered the graph structure.

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def compare_graph_metrics(original_graph, randomized_graph):
    metrics = {
        "Degree Distribution": nx.degree_histogram,
        "Clustering Coefficient": nx.average_clustering,
        "Betweenness Centrality": nx.betweenness_centrality,
    }

    results = {}
    for metric_name, metric_func in metrics.items():
        original_metric = metric_func(original_graph)
        randomized_metric = metric_func(randomized_graph)
        results[metric_name] = (original_metric, randomized_metric)

    return results

def plot_degree_distribution(original_graph, randomized_graph):
    original_degrees = nx.degree_histogram(original_graph)
    randomized_degrees = nx.degree_histogram(randomized_graph)

    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
    plt.plot(original_degrees, label="Original Graph")
    plt.plot(randomized_degrees, label="Randomized Graph")
    plt.xlabel("Degree")
    plt.ylabel("Frequency")
    plt.title("Degree Distribution")
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

# Example usage
original_graph = reactome.netx
randomized_graph = randomized_reactome.get_randomized_networkx()

metrics_comparison = compare_graph_metrics(original_graph, randomized_graph)
plot_degree_distribution(original_graph, randomized_graph)
```

### 2. Visualization

Visualize both graphs to qualitatively compare their structures.

```python
def visualize_graph(graph, title="Graph"):
    pos = nx.spring_layout(graph)
    nx.draw(graph, pos, with_labels=True, node_size=50, font_size=8, node_color='skyblue', edge_color='gray')
    plt.title(title)
    plt.show()

# Example usage
visualize_graph(original_graph, title="Original Reactome Graph")
visualize_graph(randomized_graph, title="Randomized Reactome Graph")
```

### 3. Network Performance Comparison

Train and evaluate the `PNet` models on both the original and randomized graphs to compare their performance.

```python
# Train and evaluate the original PNet model
original_maps = get_layer_maps(
    genes=[g for g in dataset.genes],
    reactome=reactome,
    n_levels=6,
    direction="root_to_leaf",
    add_unk_genes=False,
    verbose=False,
)

original_model = PNet(
    layers=original_maps,
    num_genes=original_maps[0].shape[0],
    lr=0.001
)

# Train the original model (similar to your existing code)
trainer.fit(original_model, train_loader, valid_loader)

# Train and evaluate the randomized PNet model
randomized_maps = get_layer_maps(
    genes=[g for g in dataset.genes],
    reactome=randomized_reactome,
    n_levels=6,
    direction="root_to_leaf",
    add_unk_genes=False,
    verbose=False,
)

randomized_model = PNet(
    layers=randomized_maps,
    num_genes=randomized_maps[0].shape[0],
    lr=0.001
)

# Train the randomized model (similar to your existing code)
trainer.fit(randomized_model, train_loader, valid_loader)

# Compare performance metrics
original_metrics = get_metrics(original_model, valid_loader, exp=False)
randomized_metrics = get_metrics(randomized_model, valid_loader, exp=False)

print("Original Model Metrics:", original_metrics)
print("Randomized Model Metrics:", randomized_metrics)
```

### 4. Edge Overlap

Calculate the overlap between the edges of the original and randomized graphs to ensure that the randomization has introduced new edges.

```python
def calculate_edge_overlap(original_graph, randomized_graph):
    original_edges = set(original_graph.edges)
    randomized_edges = set(randomized_graph.edges)
    overlap = original_edges.intersection(randomized_edges)
    overlap_ratio = len(overlap) / len(original_edges)
    return overlap_ratio

# Example usage
overlap_ratio = calculate_edge_overlap(original_graph, randomized_graph)
print(f"Edge Overlap Ratio: {overlap_ratio:.2f}")
```

### Summary

1. **Graph Metrics Comparison**: Compare key graph metrics to ensure structural differences.
2. **Visualization**: Visualize both graphs to qualitatively compare their structures.
3. **Network Performance Comparison**: Train and evaluate `PNet` models on both graphs to compare performance.
4. **Edge Overlap**: Calculate the overlap between the edges of the original and randomized graphs to ensure new edges have been introduced.

By using these methods, you can comprehensively compare the original and randomized graphs and the resulting networks to ensure that the randomization has worked as intended.
