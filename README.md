## AutoML Experiments for Tabular Data

### Abstract
We aim to find a good way to automatically find architectures of neural networks that represent underlying connections in the Universe of the data. 
In Biology, for example, these are usually termed "Biologically-Informed neural networks" or sometimes "Visual Neural Networks". They are built to contain Gene-Pathway or Protein-Interaction information. 

### Workpackages
- WP 1A: Build minimal running example of cancer-net (pytorch implementation of P-NET)
- WP 1B: Get P-NET Dataset
- WP 2: Search for AutoML options, that provide single edge optimization
